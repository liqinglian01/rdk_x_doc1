# 2.2 srpi-config Tool Configuration


:::info Note
The `srpi-config` configuration tool is only applicable to the `RDK X3`, `RDK X5`, and `RDK X3 Module` development boards.
:::

## Introduction

`srpi-config` is a system configuration tool. To open the configuration tool, type the following command in the command line:

```
sudo srpi-config
```

> `sudo` is a privilege escalation management command. It must be entered here to allow configuration management with root privileges. The default `sunrise` account does not have permission to modify system files.

If you are using a desktop system, you can find the `RDK Configuration` application in the menu to configure it. This will open the same configuration terminal as shown in the image above.

## System Options

The System Options menu allows you to make configuration changes to various parts such as Wi-Fi network, user password, hostname, system login mode, browser selection, as well as some system-level changes.

- **Wireless LAN**
  
  Set the `SSID` and `password` for the wireless network.

- **Password**
  
  Change the "default" user password. The default account is `sunrise`.

- **Hostname**
  
  Set the visible name of the current device on the network.

- **Boot / Auto login**
  
  Choose whether to boot to the console or desktop, and whether auto-login is required. If auto-login is selected, the system will log in using the default account `sunrise`.

- **Power LED**
  
  If the RDK model allows, you can change the behavior of the power LED in this option. The default is off or blinking.

- **Browser**
  
  If using a desktop system, you can set the default browser. If not configured, `firefox` is used by default. Users can install the `chromium` browser by running the command `sudo apt install chromium`.

## Display Options

Display Options menu.

## Interface Options

Interface Options menu, with the following options to enable/disable: SSH, VNC, SPI, I2C, I2S, Serial, and other functions.

![image-20231123103322961](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/image-20240819162241000.png)

- **SSH**
  
  Enable/disable remote login to the `RDK` using SSH. The system has the SSH option enabled by default.

- **VNC**
  
  Enable/disable the X11vnc virtual network computing server.

> VNC (Virtual Network Console) is short for Virtual Network Console. It is a remote control software. Enable this option when remotely accessing the desktop system.

- **Peripheral bus config**
  
  Enable/disable interfaces such as SPI, I2C, Serial Port, I2S, etc., on the 40-pin header. This configuration method directly modifies the `status` of the corresponding bus in the device tree file being used, and it takes effect after a reboot.
  [RDK X5] 
  X5 adds a PWM interface;
  In the table below, the interfaces in each row share the same pins, and only one function can be active at a time. When all interfaces in a row are disabled, the pins function as GPIO pins.

  | Function 1 | Function 2 | 
  | ---- | ---- |
  | serial3 | i2c5 |
  | i2c0 | pwm2 |
  | spi2 | pwm0 |
  | spi2 | pwm1 |
  | i2c1 | pwm3 |

- **Configure Wi-Fi antenna**
  Switch Wi-Fi antenna mode, supporting the selection of onboard or external antenna. Onboard antenna, External antenna.

> Supported by RDK X3 (V2.1), RDK X5 (V0.1 V1.0), RDK X5 MD (less than V1.1).

  ![img-20250903-163740](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/img-20250903-163740.png)

  Check antenna status:
  
  ```shell
  cat /boot/config.txt
  ```

  `antenna_option=trace` indicates onboard antenna, `antenna_option=cable` indicates external antenna.

- **Audio**
 Install and uninstall audio adapter boards.
 Supported audio adapter boards may include Audio Driver HAT V1, Audio Driver HAT V2, and WM8960 Audio HAT. Different hardware may support different audio adapter boards. ![image-20231123103758686](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/image-20240819164716000.png)

## Performance Options

Performance options, including overclocking, CPU operating mode and frequency locking settings, adjusting ION memory size, and other functions.

![image-20231123104234000](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/image-20231123104234000.png)

- **CPU frequency**
  
  This tool can be used to overclock the RDK's CPU. It is generally not recommended to enable this. If adequate cooling measures are taken, you can try modifying this option.

  For instructions on `CPU` scheduling for the `X5 series`, please refer to [X5 CPU Frequency Management](./04_frequency_management.md#cpu-frequency-management-1). If planning to overclock, be sure to read the `CPU Overclocking` section in the documentation to fully understand the risks and precautions.

- **ION memory**
  
  This option allows you to configure the common size of the ION memory.

> ION memory is physical memory space reserved for the BPU and image/video multimedia functions. The default size is 672MB. If you need to run relatively large algorithm models or encode/decode multiple video streams simultaneously, adjust this memory size according to your specific needs.

## Localisation Options

Localisation options, providing you with the following choices: local language, time zone, keyboard layout.

![image-20231123105018338](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/image-20231123105018338.png)

- **Locale**
  
  Select a language environment, such as configuring the Chinese environment `zh_CN.UTF-8`. Reboot for it to take effect.

- **Time Zone**
  
  Select your local time zone, starting with the region, e.g., Asia, then select a city, e.g., Shanghai. Type a letter to jump the list down to that point in the alphabet.

- **Keyboard**
  
  Reading all keyboard types takes a long time to display. Changes usually take effect immediately, but a reboot may be required.

## Advanced Options

Advanced options, allowing you to set options such as disk expansion and network proxy.

![image-20231123105616627](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/image-20231123105616627.png)

- **Expand Filesystem**
  
  This option will expand the installation to fill the entire TF card, providing more space for the file system.

> If the system is copied from another system that has already completed initial configuration, the `TF` card capacity of the system may not be automatically adjusted to the current TF card's capacity. This function can be used to conveniently complete the expansion.

- **Network Proxy Settings**
  
  Configure the network proxy settings.

- **Boot Order**
  
  RDK X3 Module and RDK X5 Module support booting the system from both eMMC and SD card modes. This option is used to switch the boot mode.

## Sensor Profiles

Provides multiple sets of `Sensor` effect library configurations to adapt to different module forms of the same `Sensor`. Due to differences in optics and calibration between modules, the final imaging effect and intensity will vary, so separate `ISP` calibration is required.

 **IMX219 Switch ISP**

   Switch the `IMX219` effect library. `1 FOV 79.3°` corresponds to the `Jetson Nano` camera, adapting to `200FOV` and `160FOV` modules. `2 FOV 120°` corresponds to the `Raspberry Pi 5` camera, adapting to `120FOV` modules.

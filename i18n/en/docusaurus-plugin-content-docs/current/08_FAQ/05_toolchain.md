* If the problem is complex, it is recommended to share the complete development machine conversion project, board-side deployment project, and detailed error reproduction method with technical support personnel via cloud storage or similar means.

### Q2: What recommended official resources are available for AI algorithm development?
**A:**
1.  **RDK User Manual - Algorithm Toolchain Chapter:** This is the most fundamental and important reference material, detailing toolchain installation, usage workflow, functions and parameters of various tools, etc.
    * General entry: [https://developer.d-robotics.cc/rdk_doc/04_toolchain_development](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/rdk_doc/04_toolchain_development) (Please refer to the official latest documentation)
2.  **RDK Model Zoo (Model Repository):** Official model example library containing porting, optimization, quantization, and deployment example code and tutorials for various common AI models on the RDK platform.
    * GitHub repository: [https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo](https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo)
3.  **D-Robotics Developer Community - Resource Center:** The community resource center section usually aggregates various development resources, including toolchain, SDK, example code, technical documentation, tutorial videos, etc.
    * Community resource center entry: [https://developer.d-robotics.cc/resource](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/resource)

### Q3: What community algorithm resources and toolchain manuals are available for the RDK X3 (Sunrise X3 Pi) platform?
**A:** For algorithm development on the RDK X3 platform, you can refer to the following OpenExplorer community resources:
* **RDK X3 Algorithm Toolchain Community Manual (OpenExplorer):**
    [https://developer.d-robotics.cc/api/v1/fileData/horizon_xj3_open_explorer_cn_doc/index.html](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/api/v1/fileData/horizon_xj3_open_explorer_cn_doc/index.html)
* **RDK X3 OpenExplore Product Release and Related Resources Post:**
    [https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/136488103547258769](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/136488103547258769)

### Q4: What community algorithm resources and toolchain manuals are available for the RDK X5 platform?
**A:** For algorithm development on the RDK X5 platform, you can refer to the following OpenExplorer community resources:
* **RDK X5 Algorithm Toolchain Community Manual (OpenExplorer):**
    [https://developer.d-robotics.cc/api/v1/fileData/x5_doc-v126cn/index.html](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/api/v1/fileData/x5_doc-v126cn/index.html) (Please note the document version number; use the latest version)
* **RDK X5 OpenExplore Product Release and Related Resources Post:**
    [https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/251934919646096384](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/251934919646096384)

### Q5: The algorithm toolchain Docker image is built based on Ubuntu 20.04. Will this affect running conversion outputs (such as .bin or .hbm model files) on RDK boards running Ubuntu 22.04?
**A:** Usually **it will not affect** operation.
Although the algorithm toolchain Docker images provided by D-Robotics OpenExplorer may be built based on Ubuntu 20.04, their main purpose is to provide an isolated **model conversion environment** containing all necessary conversion tools and dependency libraries.
The generated model files (such as `.bin` for PTQ, `.hbm` for QAT) are binary instructions and weight data targeting specific BPU architectures on RDK boards. These model files themselves are decoupled from the Ubuntu version (whether 20.04 or 22.04) of the RDK board operating system where they run, as long as the Runtime libraries on the board (such as `libdnn.so` and other BPU drivers and inference libraries) are compatible with the toolchain version used during model conversion.

### Q6: How to deploy YOLO series models (such as YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv10) on the RDK platform?
**A:** D-Robotics official and community provide rich deployment tutorials and examples for YOLO series models on the RDK platform.

* **YOLOv5 deployment on RDK X3 platform:**
    * **Full-process deployment tutorial:** [Full-process YOLOv5 Deployment on RDK X3](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/198686198578007656)
    * **YOLOv5s 2.0 version training and conversion:** If you are using YOLOv5s tag 2.0 version, you can refer to the official toolchain getting started manual to configure the development environment, and refer to this blog for training and conversion: [YOLOv5s v2.0 Training and Conversion Blog](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/163807123501918330)
    * **Higher version YOLOv5 output layer modification:** If you are using higher versions of YOLOv5 (such as v5.0, v6.0, v7.0, etc., whose output layer structure differs from v2.0), you may need to modify the model output layer to meet RDK BPU post-processing requirements. Reference blog: [High-version YOLOv5 Output Layer Modification Guide](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/177840589839214598)
    * **Board-side example post-processing note:** The post-processing part in `/app/pydev_demo/07_yolov5_sample` on RDK systems may be directly taken from training code of a specific version, with considerable redundant computation, mainly for algorithm verification. For actual deployment pursuing performance, it is recommended to refer to optimized post-processing implementations in RDK Model Zoo.

* **YOLOv8 deployment on RDK X3 platform:**
    * **Python multiprocess 30fps reference:** [CSDN Blog - YOLOv8 RDK X3 Deployment](https://blog.csdn.net/SA2672873269/article/details/139780749)

* **YOLOv10 deployment on Bayes architecture platforms (such as RDK X5):**
    * **Python multithread 30fps reference:** [CSDN Blog - YOLOv10 Bayes Platform Deployment](https://blog.csdn.net/SA2672873269/article/details/139224272)

* **General resources:** It is strongly recommended to consult **RDK Model Zoo** ([https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo](https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo)), which contains official deployment examples, pre/post-processing code, and performance optimization tips for various YOLO versions (and other mainstream models).

### Q7: When deploying YOLOv5, encountering errors like `can't reshape xxx in (84,84,3,85)`, how to resolve?
**A:** This error is usually caused by a mismatch between the preset **number of classes (num_classes)** in the post-processing code and the actual number of classes your model was trained and exported with.
For example, `85` usually represents `(x, y, w, h, confidence + num_classes)`. If your model was trained on the COCO dataset (80 classes), then `num_classes` is 80, totaling `5 + 80 = 85` output channels. If you trained a model with a custom number of classes (e.g., 10 classes), then this should be `5 + 10 = 15`.
* **Solution:** Find the YOLOv5 post-processing code file you are using (usually a Python script) and modify the defined class count parameter to match your model's actual number of classes.
* **Reference:** The above [YOLOv5s v2.0 Training and Conversion Blog](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/163807123501918330) may also contain related class count modification instructions.

### Q8: When deploying YOLOv5, detection results show a very large number of irregular detection boxes. What is the cause?
**A:** This is usually due to a mismatch between the ONNX model output head structure and the board-side post-processing code expectations.
* **Possible cause 1: Output head not modified according to BPU requirements.**
    * For higher versions of YOLOv5 (e.g., above tag 2.0), the officially exported ONNX model output layer may include feature decoding parts (e.g., directly outputting detection box coordinates and class scores), or may not separate the outputs of large, medium, and small feature maps.
    * D-Robotics RDK BPU deployment typically requires ONNX model outputs to be raw feature maps, with these three feature maps as independent output nodes.
    * **Example images (top: incorrect, bottom: partially correct but still needs adjustment):**
        ![YOLOv5 incorrect output head example](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/08_FAQ/image/AI_toolchain/3.png)
        ![YOLOv5 incorrect output head example](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/08_FAQ/image/AI_toolchain/4.jfif) 
      *Top image: Feature maps not separated, includes decoding. Bottom image: Feature maps separated, but may have incorrectly added Sigmoid or not converted to NHWC.*
* **Solution:**
    * You need to modify the YOLOv5 export script (usually `models/yolo.py` or similar files) to ensure when exporting the ONNX model:
        1.  Remove the detection head at the end of the model (decoding layers, NMS, etc.).
        2.  Use three feature maps of different scales (P3, P4, P5 or corresponding layers) as independent output nodes.
        3.  Ensure the output dimension order meets toolchain requirements (e.g., sometimes need to convert from NCHW to NHWC).
        4.  Do not incorrectly add unnecessary activation functions (such as Sigmoid) after the final output layer unless the post-processing code explicitly requires them.
    * **Reference tutorial:** [High-version YOLOv5 Output Layer Modification Guide](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/177840589839214598) provides detailed modification instructions.

### Q9: When deploying YOLOv5, detection results show abnormally arranged detection boxes with periodic patterns. What is the cause?
**A:**
* **Possible cause: Output dimensions mismatch with post-processing.**
    * If the YOLOv5 model you use (e.g., official versions below tag 2.0) exports ONNX with each output head having 5 dimensions (e.g., `[batch, num_anchors, grid_h, grid_w, (x,y,w,h,conf+classes)]` or a flattened form like `[batch, num_anchors* (5+num_classes), grid_h, grid_w]`).
    * When the D-Robotics BPU toolchain compiles such models, if used directly, dimension processing or post-processing code expectations may cause a certain dimension to be truncated or incorrectly parsed, resulting in periodically arranged abnormal detection boxes.
    * **Example image:**
        ![YOLOv5 periodic abnormal detection box example](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/08_FAQ/image/AI_toolchain/5.png) * **Solution:**
    * The recommended approach is to convert outputs to explicit 4D tensors when exporting the ONNX model (e.g., NHWC format: `[batch, grid_h, grid_w, num_anchors*(5+num_classes)]`), and in board-side post-processing code, correctly parse and decode according to this NHWC output format (e.g., reshape back to 5D or perform corresponding anchor calculations).
    * Ensure your post-processing logic fully matches the final output dimensions and arrangement of the ONNX model.

### Q10: When deploying YOLOv5, detection box positions are overall offset. What is the cause?
**A:**
1.  **Rendering size mismatch with original image size:**
    * Detection box coordinates calculated by post-processing code are usually relative to the model input image size (e.g., 640x640). If you draw these coordinates directly on an original image or display canvas of a different size without corresponding scaling and translation, detection box positions will be offset.
    * **Solution:** Ensure that before rendering detection boxes, model output coordinates are mapped back to the original image coordinate system proportionally (`original image width / model input width`, `original image height / model input height`). If padding was applied before model input, reverse mapping also needs to account for removing padding effects.
2.  **Anchors mismatch:**
    * YOLOv5 detection box decoding depends on preset anchor boxes (anchors). If one set of anchors was used during model training but a different set of anchors is used in post-processing code (or anchor order/scaling is inconsistent), decoded detection box positions and sizes will be incorrect.
    * **Solution:** Ensure the anchor parameters used in post-processing code (usually 18 numbers representing width and height of 3 anchors per layer on 3 feature maps) are completely consistent with anchors used during model training.

### Q11: When deploying YOLOv5, detection boxes abnormally cluster in the upper-left corner of the image. What could be the cause?
**A:**
* **Possible cause: Post-processing library parameter passing issue (specifically in examples in certain system versions).**
    * In RDK OS 3.0.0 and above, examples such as `/app/pydev_demo/07_yolov5_sample` may use CPython-wrapped post-processing libraries. If key parameters such as model training class count are not correctly passed to the initialization or invocation interface of this post-processing library, decoding logic errors may occur, causing detection boxes to cluster in the upper-left corner.
    * **Example image:**
        ![YOLOv5 detection boxes clustered in upper-left corner example](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/08_FAQ/image/AI_toolchain/7.png) * **Solution:**
    * **Recommend using RDK Model Zoo post-processing:** For YOLOv5 and similar model verification and deployment, it is strongly recommended to refer to or directly use post-processing code provided in **RDK Model Zoo** ([https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo](https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo)). Model Zoo implementations are usually more robust, optimized, and work more closely with the toolchain.
    * **Check parameter passing:** If you insist on using board example post-processing, carefully check the example code to ensure all necessary parameters (such as class count, input resolution, anchors, confidence threshold, NMS threshold, etc.) are correctly configured and passed to post-processing functions or classes.

### Q12: When running the onboard `/app/pydev_demo/07_yolov5_sample` example with your own model, getting `Segmentation fault`, what to do?
**A:**
* **Cause:** Onboard official example programs (such as `07_yolov5_sample`) are usually **adapted and tested for their bundled pre-converted `.bin` models**. The preprocessing, model loading, BPU inference invocation, and post-processing logic of this example are all designed around that specific bundled model.
* If you replace the `.bin` file in the example with your own (possibly different structure, input/output, post-processing logic) YOLOv5 model without correspondingly modifying preprocessing, post-processing, or model parameter parts in the example code, `Segmentation fault` is very likely due to data format mismatch, memory access out of bounds, etc.
* **Solution:**
    1.  **Do not expect it to run by simply replacing the bin file:** In principle, for models you train and convert yourself, you need to write or modify a complete inference program (including preprocessing, BPU inference interface invocation, post-processing) that matches it.
    2.  **Refer to RDK Model Zoo:** For common models like YOLOv5, it is strongly recommended to refer to deployment examples for corresponding models in **RDK Model Zoo** ([https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo](https://github.com/D-Robotics/rdk_model_zoo)). Model Zoo usually provides more general and clearer preprocessing and post-processing code implementations that you can adapt for your own models.
    3.  **Understand post-processing:** Carefully learn YOLOv5 post-processing principles (including anchor decoding, confidence filtering, NMS, etc.), and ensure your post-processing code fully corresponds to your model output feature map format, dimensions, and content.

### Q13: Model inference detects no results, or results are far worse than expected. What aspects should be checked (Pipeline check flow)?
**A:** 
When model deployment performance is poor or has no output, you need to systematically check the entire inference pipeline:

1.  **Data preprocessing check:**
    * **Consistency with training:** This is the most critical point. Ensure deployment preprocessing operations (such as resize method, normalization parameters, mean/variance, color space conversion like RGB/BGR, letterbox padding method and color, etc.) are **completely consistent** with preprocessing used during model training. Any subtle difference may cause model performance to drop sharply.
    * **Visualize preprocessing results:** Save preprocessed image data (e.g., if input is an image, save the processed image; if numpy array, visualize it) and compare with data fed to the model during training to see if they match.
    * **Toolchain `yaml` configuration:** When using the D-Robotics toolchain for model conversion (PTQ), the `yaml` configuration file contains preprocessing-related parameters (such as `norm_type`, `mean_value`, `std_value`, etc.). Ensure these parameters correctly "offset" preprocessing you performed before feeding calibration data to the toolchain, so the toolchain sees calibration data with input distribution consistent with before the first convolution layer during model training.

2.  **Model conversion process check:**
    * **Toolchain version:** Use the officially recommended latest stable algorithm toolchain version.
    * **`yaml` configuration:** Carefully check the `yaml` configuration file during model conversion to ensure all parameters (such as input node name, output node name, input data type, input layout, model type, BPU architecture, etc.) are set correctly.
    * **Calibration dataset (PTQ):**
        * Quality and representativeness of calibration dataset is crucial for PTQ quantized model accuracy. The dataset should be similar to actual application scenario data distribution.
        * Calibration data preprocessing as mentioned above must be consistent with deployment (or rather, calibration data fed to the toolchain should be "reverse-preprocessed" so the toolchain performs correct quantization calibration internally).
    * **Quantization-sensitive layer analysis:** If accuracy drops significantly after PTQ, use toolchain-provided accuracy analysis tools (such as layer-by-layer comparison, dumping layer data) to locate layers sensitive to quantization, then try mixed-precision quantization (some layers use higher precision or float) or QAT (Quantization-Aware Training).
    * **Conversion logs:** Carefully read complete logs output by the toolchain during model conversion, looking for any errors, warnings, or hints.

3.  **BPU inference and board-side Runtime check:**
    * **Input data preparation:** Ensure data fed to board-side BPU inference interface fully matches input format (layout, data type, shape) defined during model conversion.
    * **Memory management:** Check input/output buffer allocation and copying for correctness; watch for memory corruption or out-of-bounds access.
    * **Runtime version:** Ensure BPU drivers and Runtime libraries (`libdnn.so`, etc.) on the board are compatible with the toolchain version used during model conversion.
    * **API calls:** Check BPU inference API call order and parameter settings for correctness.

4.  **Postprocessing check:**
    * **Match with model output:** Ensure post-processing code logic (such as parsing output feature maps, decoding detection boxes, applying NMS, threshold processing, etc.) fully matches format, dimensions, and meaning of actual output nodes after model conversion.
    * **Parameter consistency:** Various parameters used in post-processing (such as anchors, class count, confidence threshold, NMS threshold, score_threshold, etc.) must be consistent with model design and training.
    * **Coordinate mapping:** If necessary, ensure model output coordinates are correctly mapped back to original image size.
    * **Logic errors:** Carefully check post-processing code for logic bugs.

5.  **End-to-end verification:**
    * **Use known input and output:** Ideally have samples from training or validation sets where you know the correct detection results (Ground Truth). Run these samples through your entire deployment pipeline and compare actual output with expected output.
    * **Module-by-module verification:** If possible, split the entire pipeline into preprocessing, model inference, post-processing modules and verify input/output of each module separately.

### Q14: How to obtain board-side `hrt_*` series performance analysis tools (such as `hrt_model_exec`, `hrt_bpu_monitor`, etc.)?
**A:** D-Robotics RDK system images, or packages released with algorithm toolchain/SDK, usually include command-line tools for board-side model execution, performance analysis, and debugging. They generally start with `hrt_` (Horizon Robotics Tool).
* **Search locations:**
    * These tools may be pre-installed in RDK system image paths such as `/usr/bin` or `/opt/hobot/bin`.
    * They may also be included in a subdirectory of the algorithm toolchain package you download (after extraction) (e.g., `ddk/package/board/<target_os>/bin/` or similar paths). You need to manually copy these tools to an executable path on the board (such as `/usr/local/bin`) or run them directly on the board by specifying their full path.
* **Official resource post:** The D-Robotics developer community usually has dedicated posts or documentation explaining how to obtain and use these board-side tools. For example, this post previously provided related information:
    [Board-side hrt_* Tool Download and Usage Instructions](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/228559182180396599) (Please confirm link and content validity)
* **Common tools:**
    * `hrt_model_exec`: Used to execute converted `.bin` models on the board for inference verification and performance testing.
    * `hrt_bpu_monitor` (or performance printing parts in `hrut_somstatus`, `bpu_predict_xN_sample`): Used to monitor BPU real-time usage, frequency, temperature, and other status.
    * Other specific debugging tools.

Please refer to the latest RDK documentation or community resources for accurate information and download methods for these tools.

### Model Quantization and Board Deployment Usage Tips

#### Transformer Usage Instructions

This section explains the concepts and parameters of each transformer and provides reference usage examples to help you perform transformer operations.

Before reading the documentation content, please note the following:

- Image data is ``3-dimensional data``, but transformers provided by D-Robotics obtain and process data in ``4-dimensional data`` format. The transformer only performs the operation on the ``0th`` image in the input data.

##### AddTransformer

**Description**:

Adds the value to all pixel values in the input image. This transformer converts the data format to float32 on output.

**Parameters**:

- value: The value to add to each pixel. Note that value can be negative, such as -128.

**Usage examples**:

``` bash
  # Subtract 128 from image data
  AddTransformer(-128)

  # Add 127 to image data
  AddTransformer(127)
```

##### MeanTransformer

**Description**:

Subtracts mean_value from all pixel values in the input image.

**Parameters**:

- means: The value to subtract from each pixel. Note that value can be negative, such as -128.

- data_format: Input layout type, range ["CHW","HWC"], default "CHW".

**Usage examples**:

``` bash
  # Subtract 128.0 from each pixel, input type is CHW
  MeanTransformer(np.array([128.0, 128.0, 128.0])) 

  # Subtract different values 103.94, 116.78, 123.68 from each pixel, input type is HWC
  MeanTransformer(np.array([103.94, 116.78, 123.68]), data_format="HWC") 
```

##### ScaleTransformer

**Description**:

Multiplies all pixel values in the input image by the data_scale coefficient.

**Parameters**:

- scale_value: The coefficient to multiply by, such as 0.0078125 or 1/128.

**Usage examples**:

```bash

  # Adjust all pixels in range -128~127 to -1~1
  ScaleTransformer(0.0078125) 
  # or
  ScaleTransformer(1/128)
```

##### NormalizeTransformer

**Description**:

Used for normalizing the input image. This transformer converts the data format to float32 on output.

**Parameters**:

- std: The value to divide the first input image by.

**Usage examples**:

``` bash
  # Adjust all pixels in range [-128, 127] to -1~1
  NormalizeTransformer(128) 
```

##### TransposeTransformer

**Description**:

Used for layout conversion operations.

**Parameters**:

- order: The order after layout conversion of the input image (order relates to the original layout order). For example: HWC order is 0,1,2; when converting to CHW, order is (2,0,1).

##### ResizeTransformer

**Description**:

Used to resize images.

**Parameters**:

- target_size: Target size, tuple value such as (240,240).

- mode: Image processing mode, range ("skimage", "opencv"), default "skimage".

- method: Interpolation method, effective only when mode is skimage. Range 0-5, default 1, where:

  - 0 represents Nearest-neighbor;

  - 1 represents Bi-linear (default);

  - 2 represents Bi-quadratic;

  - 3 represents Bi-cubic;

  - 4 represents Bi-quartic;

  - 5 represents Bi-quintic.

- data_type: Output type, range (uint8, float), default float. When set to uint8, output type is uint8; otherwise float32.

- interpolation: Interpolation method, effective only when mode is opencv. Default empty, range (opencv interpolation methods).
  Currently interpolation only supports empty or INTER_CUBIC in opencv. When interpolation is empty, INTER_LINEAR is used by default.

  The following are opencv-supported interpolation methods and descriptions (unsupported methods will be gradually supported in future iterations):

  - INTER_NEAREST, nearest-neighbor interpolation;

  - INTER_LINEAR, bilinear interpolation, used by default when interpolation is empty.

  - INTER_CUBIC, bicubic interpolation within 4x4 pixel neighborhood.

  - INTER_AREA, resampling using pixel area relation. May be preferred for image decimation as it can provide moire-free results. But when image is scaled, it is similar to INTER_NEAREST.

  - INTER_LANCZOS4, Lanczos interpolation in 8x8 neighborhood.

  - INTER_LINEAR_EXACT, bit-exact bilinear interpolation.

  - INTER_NEAREST_EXACT, bit-exact nearest-neighbor interpolation. Produces same results as nearest-neighbor methods in PIL, scikit-image, or Matlab.

  - INTER_MAX, mask for interpolation codes.

  - WARP_FILL_OUTLIERS, flag, fill all destination image pixels. If some correspond to outliers in source image, set them to zero.

  - WARP_INVERSE_MAP, flag, inverse transform.

``` bash
  # Resize input image to 224*224, use opencv mode, bilinear interpolation, output float32
  ResizeTransformer(target_size=(224, 224), mode='opencv', method=1)

  # Resize input image to 256*256, use skimage mode, bilinear interpolation, output float32
  ResizeTransformer(target_size=(256, 256))

  # Resize input image to 256*256, use skimage mode, bilinear interpolation, output uint8

```

##### ShortLongResizeTransformer

**Description**:

Scales the input image proportionally. The new image size depends on the set parameters. Operation steps:

1. First divide short_size by the minimum of original image width and height to get the scale factor.

2. When scale factor multiplied by the maximum of original image width and height exceeds long_size, the scale factor changes to long_size divided by the maximum of original image width and height.

3. Use opencv resize method to recrop the image according to the scale factor obtained above.

**Parameters**:

- short_size: Expected length of the short side after cropping.

- long_size: Expected length of the long side after cropping.

- include_im: Default True. When set to True, returns both the processed image and the original image.

**Usage examples**:

``` bash
  # Short side length 20, long side length 100, return processed image and original image
  ShortLongResizeTransformer(short_size=20, long_size=100)
```

##### PadTransformer

**Description**:

Divides target size by the maximum of input image width or height as coefficient, then multiplies original width and height by this coefficient to resize the image.
Then based on new image size, divide by size_divisor, round up, multiply by size_divisor for new width and height, generating a new image.

**Parameters**:

- size_divisor: Size divisor, default 128.

- target_size: Target size, default 512.

**Usage examples**:

``` bash
  # Pad size 1024*1024

#### Example YOLOv5x Model Usage Instructions

1. YOLOv5x model:

  - You can download the corresponding pt file from URL: [yolov5-2.0](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/tag/v2.0).

    When cloning the code, please confirm you are using Tags ``v2.0``, otherwise conversion will fail.

  - md5sum codes:

|           **md5sum**             | **File**   |
| -------------------------------- | -----------|
| 2e296b5e31bf1e1b6b8ea4bf36153ea5 | yolov5l.pt |
| 16150e35f707a2f07e7528b89c032308 | yolov5m.pt |
| 42c681cf466c549ff5ecfe86bcc491a0 | yolov5s.pt |
| 069a6baa2a741dec8a2d44a9083b6d6e | yolov5x.pt |

  - To better adapt to post-processing code, we made the following modifications to the Github code before ONNX model export
    (code see: [https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/v2.0/models/yolo.py](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/v2.0/models/yolo.py) ):

```python

    def forward(self, x):
        # x = x.copy()  # for profiling
        z = []  # inference output
        self.training |= self.export
        for i in range(self.nl):
            x[i] = self.m[i](x[i])  # conv
            bs, _, ny, nx = x[i].shape  # x(bs,255,20,20) to x(bs,3,20,20,85)
            #  x[i] = x[i].view(bs, self.na, self.no, ny, nx).permute(0, 1, 3, 4, 2).contiguous()
            x[i] = x[i].permute(0, 2, 3, 1).contiguous()
```

-   **Note:** 
      Removed the 4D to 5D reshape at the tail of each output branch (i.e., do not split channel from 255 into 3x85), then convert layout from NHWC to NCHW before output.

    The left image below shows visualization of an output node before modification; the right image shows the corresponding output node after modification.

    ![yolov5](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/08_FAQ/image/multimedia/yolov5.png)

- After download, convert pt file to ONNX file using script https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/v2.0/models/export.py.

-    **Notes**

      When using the export.py script, please note:

      1. Since D-Robotics AI toolchain supports ONNX opset versions ``10`` and ``11``, please modify the ``opset_version`` parameter of ``torch.onnx.export`` according to the version you want to use.
      2. Change the default input name parameter of ``torch.onnx.export`` from ``'images'`` 
         to ``'data'``, consistent with the YOLOv5x example script in the model conversion sample package.
      3. Change the default data input size 640x640 in the ``parser.add_argument`` section to 672x672 in the YOLOv5x example in the model conversion sample package.

#### Model Accuracy Tuning Checklist{#checklist}

Please strictly follow steps 1-5 in the diagram below for model accuracy verification and retain code and results for each step:

![model_accuracy_check](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/08_FAQ/image/multimedia/model_accuracy_check.png)

**Before troubleshooting, please confirm the Docker image or conversion environment version used for current model conversion, and retain version information**

##### 1. Verify floating-point onnx model inference results

Enter the model conversion environment to test single-image results of the floating-point onnx model (specifically the onnx model exported from the DL framework). Results at this step should be completely consistent with post-training model inference results (except nv12 format, which may introduce slight differences).

Refer to the following example code steps to confirm inference steps, data preprocessing, and post-processing code for the floating-point onnx model are correct!

```python  

  from horizon_tc_ui import HB_ONNXRuntime
  import numpy as np
  import cv2

  def preprocess(input_name):
      # BGR->RGB, Resize, CenterCrop···      
      # HWC->CHW      
      # normalization      
      return data

  def main(): 
      # Load model file
      sess = HB_ONNXRuntime(model_file=MODEL_PATH)
      # Get input & output node names
      input_names = [input.name for input in sess.get_inputs()]
      output_names = [output.name for output in sess.get_outputs()]
      # Prepare model input data
      feed_dict = dict()
      for input_name in input_names:
          feed_dict[input_name] = preprocess(input_name)
          
      # Original floating-point onnx, data dtype=float32     
      outputs = sess.run_feature(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=0)     
      
      # Post-processing
      postprocess(outputs)
          
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

```

##### 2. Verify yaml configuration file and pre/post-processing code correctness

Test single-image results of the original_float.onnx model. Results should be completely consistent with floating-point onnx model inference results (except nv12 format; due to nv12 data loss, slight differences may be introduced).

Use the open-source tool Netron to open the ``original_float.onnx`` model and view detailed attributes of the preprocessing node ``HzPreprocess`` operator to obtain parameters needed for ``data preprocessing``: ``data_format`` and ``input_type``.

Due to the existence of the HzPreprocess node, preprocessing operations of the converted model may differ from the original model. This operator is added during model conversion based on configuration parameters in the yaml file (input_type_rt, input_type_train, norm_type, mean_value, scale_value). For preprocessing node generation details, refer to the ``norm_type configuration parameter description`` section in PTQ Principles and Steps. Additionally, preprocessing nodes appear in all products generated during conversion.

Ideally, this HzPreprocess node should complete the full conversion from input_type_rt to input_type_train. However, in practice the entire type conversion process requires D-Robotics AI chip hardware, but the ONNX model does not include the hardware conversion part. Therefore, the actual ONNX input type uses an intermediate type, which is the hardware processing result type of input_type_rt. Thus, for image input data types: RGB/BGR/NV12/YUV444/GRAY with data dtype=uint8, preprocessing code needs to perform ``-128`` operation; for featuremap data type using float32, preprocessing code ``does not need -128`` operation; original_float.onnx data layout (NCHW/NHWC) remains consistent with the original floating-point model input layout.

Refer to the following example code steps to confirm inference steps, data preprocessing, and post-processing code for the original_float.onnx model are correct!

**For data preprocessing, it is recommended to refer to preprocessing steps in caffe, onnx, and other example models in the D-Robotics model conversion ``horizon_model_convert_sample`` sample package**

```python

  from horizon_tc_ui import HB_ONNXRuntime
  import numpy as np
  import cv2

  def preprocess(input_name):
      # BGR->RGB, Resize, CenterCrop···      
      # HWC->CHW (determine whether layout conversion is needed based on specific shape of onnx model input node)
      # normalization (if norm operation was placed in model via yaml file, do not repeat in preprocessing)
      #-128 (for image input models, only need to perform -128 in preprocessing when using hb_session.run interface; other interfaces control via input_offset)
      return data

  def main(): 
      # Load model file
      sess = HB_ONNXRuntime(model_file=MODEL_PATH)
      # Get input & output node names
      input_names = [input.name for input in sess.get_inputs()]
      output_names = [output.name for output in sess.get_outputs()]
      # Prepare model input data
      feed_dict = dict()
      for input_name in input_names:
          feed_dict[input_name] = preprocess(input_name)
      # Image input models (RGB/BGR/NV12/YUV444/GRAY), data dtype= uint8     
      outputs = sess.run(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=128)         
      # featuremap model, data dtype=float32, comment out the line below if model input is not featuremap!
      outputs = sess.run_feature(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=0)     
      # Post-processing
      postprocess(outputs)
          
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

```

##### 3. Verify graph optimization stage did not introduce accuracy errors

Test single-image results of the optimize_float.onnx model. Results should be completely consistent with original_float.onnx inference results.

Use the open-source tool Netron to open the ``optimize_float.onnx`` model and view detailed attributes of the preprocessing node ``HzPreprocess`` operator to obtain parameters needed for data preprocessing: ``data_format`` and ``input_type``; 

For optimize_float.onnx model inference, refer to the following example code steps to confirm inference steps, data preprocessing, and post-processing code for the optimize_float.onnx model are correct!

**For data preprocessing, it is recommended to refer to preprocessing steps in caffe, onnx, and other example models in the D-Robotics model conversion ``horizon_model_convert_sample`` sample package**

```python

  from horizon_tc_ui import HB_ONNXRuntime
  import numpy as np
  import cv2

  def preprocess(input_name):
      # BGR->RGB, Resize, CenterCrop···      
      # HWC->CHW (determine whether layout conversion is needed based on specific shape of onnx model input node)
      # normalization (if norm operation was placed in model via yaml file, do not repeat in preprocessing)
      #-128 (for image input models, only need to perform -128 in preprocessing when using hb_session.run interface; other interfaces control via input_offset)
      return data

  def main(): 
      # Load model file
      sess = HB_ONNXRuntime(model_file=MODEL_PATH)
      # Get input & output node names
      input_names = [input.name for input in sess.get_inputs()]
      output_names = [output.name for output in sess.get_outputs()]
      # Prepare model input data
      feed_dict = dict()
      for input_name in input_names:
          feed_dict[input_name] = preprocess(input_name)
      # Image input models (RGB/BGR/NV12/YUV444/GRAY), data dtype= uint8     
      outputs = sess.run(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=128)         
      # featuremap model, data dtype=float32, comment out the line below if model input is not featuremap!
      outputs = sess.run_feature(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=0)     
      # Post-processing
      postprocess(outputs)
          
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

```

##### 4. Verify quantization accuracy meets expectations  

Test accuracy metrics of quantized.onnx.

Use the open-source tool Netron to open the ``quantized.onnx`` model and view detailed attributes of the preprocessing node ``HzPreprocess`` operator to obtain parameters needed for data preprocessing: ``data_format`` and ``input_type``; 

For quantized.onnx model inference, refer to the following example code steps to confirm inference steps, data preprocessing, and post-processing code for the quantized.onnx model are correct!

**For data preprocessing, it is recommended to refer to preprocessing steps in caffe, onnx, and other example models in the D-Robotics model conversion ``horizon_model_convert_sample`` sample package**

```python

  from horizon_tc_ui import HB_ONNXRuntime
  import numpy as np
  import cv2

  def preprocess(input_name):
      # BGR->RGB, Resize, CenterCrop···      
      # HWC->CHW (determine whether layout conversion is needed based on specific shape of onnx model input node)
      # normalization (if norm operation was placed in model via yaml file, do not repeat in preprocessing)
      #-128 (for image input models, only need to perform -128 in preprocessing when using hb_session.run interface; other interfaces control via input_offset)
      return data

  def main(): 
      # Load model file
      sess = HB_ONNXRuntime(model_file=MODEL_PATH)
      # Get input & output node names
      input_names = [input.name for input in sess.get_inputs()]
      output_names = [output.name for output in sess.get_outputs()]
      # Prepare model input data
      feed_dict = dict()
      for input_name in input_names:
          feed_dict[input_name] = preprocess(input_name)
      # Image input models (RGB/BGR/NV12/YUV444/GRAY), data dtype= uint8     
      outputs = sess.run(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=128)         
      # featuremap model, data dtype=float32, comment out the line below if model input is not featuremap!
      outputs = sess.run_feature(output_names, feed_dict, input_offset=0)     
      # Post-processing
      postprocess(outputs)
          
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

```

##### 5. Ensure model compilation is error-free and board-side inference code is correct

Use the ``hb_model_verifier`` tool to verify consistency between quantized.onnx and .bin. Model outputs should at least align to 2-3 decimal places.

For ``hb_model_verifier`` tool usage (detailed introduction available), refer to the ``hb_model_verifier tool`` section in PTQ Principles and Steps.

If model consistency verification passes, carefully check board-side pre/post-processing code!

If quantized.onnx and .bin model consistency verification fails, please contact D-Robotics technical personnel.

#### X3 Multi-core BPU Usage Instructions

Since X3 has 2 BPU cores, there are single-core and dual-core model scenarios in BPU usage. For multi-core BPU usage notes, refer to: [X3 Multi-core BPU Reasonable Usage Tips and Recommendations](https://developer.d-robotics.cc/forumDetail/136488103547258549)

#### Fixed-point .bin Model Multi-batch Board Deployment Instructions

- 1. During model conversion, configure batch_size via input_batch in the yaml configuration file;
- 2. For board .bin model input, using original model dimension 1×3×224×224 with input_batch set to 10, i.e., 10×3×224×224 dimension as example:
- Data preparation:

    Image data: Set ``aligned_shape = valid_shape``, then following single-image data preparation, write 10 images sequentially in order into the allocated memory space;

    FeatureMap data: Pad data according to aligned_shape, then following single-batch data preparation, write 10 batches of data sequentially in order into the allocated memory space. Model inference flow is the same as single-batch model inference flow;
